            <p>Kopatych was plowing in his garden, and Nyusha was telling him a story. While telling it, Nyusha fell in front of Kopatych, and from fear he stepped on the rake several times and lost consciousness. Later, Losyash, Kar-Karych, Krosh and Yozhik helped the gardener. The last two told how it all happened, but Karych did not believe them, and immediately put on a small performance. He thinks like this: Nyusha (Krosh decided to play this role) was walking in very thick grass, not seeing the rake. And Kopatych (the role was given to Yozhik) saw that she would step on the rake, and decided to sacrifice himself. Losyash admired Kar-Karych's idea, and later decided to repeat it. The next day, Kopatych woke up, and his friends began to demonstrate the story that Karych had made up. Surprised, Kopatych accidentally stepped on the rake again, and Karych presented this as proof that he was right </p>
